#### Using the Application

2. The first operation that the web application can do is to count the number of tweets, given a keyword e.g. `#ibm` or `binay`


The Result for the #ibm query will look like this

```
	 {"related":{"search":{"href":"https://cdeservice.mybluemix.net:443/api/v1/messages/search?q=%23ibm"}},"search":{"results":198618}} 
```

This output which is in `JSON` format, shows the url that we used to access the Insights for Twitter Service

```
	 {"related":{"search":{"href":"https://cdeservice.mybluemix.net:443/api/v1/messages/search?q=%23ibm"}}
```

As well as the results of the query, to count how many tweets included the keyword

```
"search":{"results":198618}} 
```

3. The next operation that the web application can do is to search for tweets using a keyword. e.g. `#Duterte` and specifiying how many tweets regarding the keyword you want to see `1`

4. For the first text field enter `#Duterte` , for the next text field enter `1`

	>This will search for 1 tweet which includes #Duterte in its content.

The Result for the Query will look like this

```

```

The output also shows the url that we used to access the Insights for Twitter Service

```
"related":{"next":{"href":"https://cdeservice.mybluemix.net:443/api/v1/messages/search?q=%23Duterte&from=1&size=1"}}}


```

#### Analyzing how the Application Works

In this tutorial, we were able to create an Insights for Twitter application which uses the operations provided by the
Insights for Twitter service.

First, in order for the application to access the service it needs to use the credentials of the service. You must login using your service credentials. It will use the credentials listed for insights-for-twitter in VCAP_SERVICES which is seen in Bluemix

````
                    JSONObject creds = (JSONObject) service.get("credentials");
                    String username = (String) creds.get("username");
                    String password = (String) creds.get("password");
                    String host = (String) creds.get("host");
                    Long port = (Long) creds.get("port");
                    String url = (String) creds.get("url");
